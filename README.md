Please visit our former page for information about the Range Analysis:
https://code.google.com/archive/p/range-analysis/

I haven't had time to migrate our wiki pages to GitHub.

Note: I am in the process ot updating Range Analysis to work with the latest version of LLVM.

Any question? Email me at victorsc -at dcc.ufmg.br
